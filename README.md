# Private Issues plugin for ChiliProject

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jnv/chiliproject_private_issues.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jnv/chiliproject_private_issues)

Allows individual issues to be marked as private. These issues are can be viewed only by roles with "View private issues" permission. This is similar to the standard functionality in Redmine (see [ChiliProject's bugtracker](https://www.chiliproject.org/issues/189)).

## Installation

1. Follow the instructions at https://www.chiliproject.org/projects/chiliproject/wiki/Plugin_Install
2. Two new permissions will be available for roles: "View private issues" and "Manage private issues" (to manage privacy of the issue)

## Compatibility

Plugin was tested with ChiliProject 3.1.0 and Ruby 1.9.3.
